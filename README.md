# Business Rule Validation of Flight-Plan
Developing a business rule validation that checks business rules and criteria of flight plan XML files (FF-ICE files) for an air traffic management 

# BUSINESS RULE VALIDATION
Business rules are the rules that define or constrain some aspects of business and set to either true or false. This can apply to people, processes, corporate behaviors, or computing systems and it is intended to influence the behavior of the business to help the organization to achieve its goals. Business rules are formalized in a language that managers and technologists can understand. Business rules exist for an organization whether or not they are ever written down, talked about or even part of the organizationâ€™s consciousness. Building a business rule develops a strategy to provide high-level direction about what an organization should do and business rules to provide detailed guidance about how a strategy can be translated into action.

# FFICE
FFICE stands for Flight and Flow Information for a Collaborative Environment defines all requirements for flight plan information. FFICE data supports ATM industry to achieve strategic and tactical performance management with emphasizing the need for data sharing to improve efficiency and benefits to ATM industry. The data exchange of flight and flow information is the potentially promising system of present and future ATM industry.

The criteria for FFICE Business Rule Validation are provided by the FIXM committee. In simple terms, there are number of FFICM XML Elements that need to exist in the message for it to be business rule valid. The idea of Business Rule Validation of flight plan is when XML messages come in and before it goes out, first, the message is checked against the schema to make sure it is valid, which means that checking the data is in the right place, data values are there and matching the right pattern. Second, the message is checked against the business rules, which means to make sure that all the required elements do exist within the message.
